                    <p class="large text-muted">Bo's background is in high energy physics working on recreating moments after the big bang using experiments at CERN. Shortly after, he tried his luck in the energy field as a embedded engineer at Stem Inc. to control behind the meter storage. Since, Bo has been a consultant for several enegy startups before landing softly at Watt-Learn. At Watt-Learn he is leading the development of our cloud-based software infrastructure.</p>
