We will work closely with you to customize our PLAAS solution to your project’s specifications and needs. We will go back in time and simulate the operation of your project using PLAAS with different configurations to demonstrate the value that could have been generated for your project in variety of scenarios (e.g., revenue/ saving, lifetime, cycles, etc.).</p>

You will receive a forward-looking dispatch setpoints, on realtime basis, which act as recommendations that can be either incorporated into the battery control system, or used to shadow the existing strategies.</p>

PLAAS serves as an intelligence layer on top of the existing battery control system. It sends proactive setpoints to your battery’s management system to maximize a customized set of objectives for your very specific project (e.g., revenue/ savings, number of cycles, lifetime, carbon footprint, etc. or a combination of all). Our solution is non-intrusive, technology agnostic, and cloud-based.</p>
