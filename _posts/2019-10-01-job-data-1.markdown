  title: Description
  text: "Using machine learning and optimization algorithms, WattLearn’s Proactive Lifetime-Aware Automation System (PLAAS) continuously determines the optimal strategy for controlling grid-scale energy storage devices. We are looking for a driven and talented Senior Data Scientist to improve these algorithms as well as build new capabilities as we expand into new markets and value streams. As a key member of a small but experienced team, you will play an integral role in shaping the future of both the data science team and the company itself while also contributing to a more sustainable energy future. 
While your focus will be on Data Science, you will will have input into all parts of the product life cycle: research and ad hoc analyses, data processing and engineering, model development, testing and quality assurance, and even operations. 
Your work will be highly visible throughout the company and will contribute to the foundation for our go-to-market product. As one of the core members of the team, you will have direct input in building a roadmap to meet company milestones. The person who fills this role will report directly to the CEO."
