                    <p class="text-muted">Batteries are one of the most promising technologies for the job. However, in spite of the recent advances in various battery technologies, it is still quite difficult to build economical battery projects. The industry so far has been mainly focused on reducing the cost of the hardware. For example, in the past decade, the cost of lithium-ion batteries has dropped by more than 73%. Reducing the hardware cost, however, is only one aspect of the problem. There are more, and often conflicting, components that go into the equation.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="service-heading"></h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">Traditional solutions for dispatching battery projects are typically reactive, sub-optimal, and ignorant of battery life. They either over-cycle the battery to increase the value generated, which compromises the life of the battery, or over-size and under-utilize the battery to preserve its life, which reduces the overall value generated from the project.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="service-heading"></h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">WattLearn's technology is the best in class to balance between three pillars of battery economy|: the overall life of the project, the cost associated with the project, and the total value generated from the project.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="service-heading"></h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">Using AI, optimization, and cloud-based computing concepts, our PLAAS technology offers proactive and optimal solutions for often-conflicting objectives derived by energy systems constraints, energy market dynamics, economic & operational objectives, and even uncertainties rooted in human behavior.</p>

The founders, <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianlamy/'> Julian Lamy</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/matineh-eybpoosh-647b5134'>Matineh Eybpoosh</a>, have decades of combined experience in tackling some of the most challenging problems in the energy space. In 2016, through his studies of energy storage markets, Julian realizes that one very important factor is missing for batteries:: intelligence. Current batteries are simply too dumb to be profitable. Combining their multidisciplinary background, Julian and Matineh designed machine-learning based software to solve this problem and thereby change the future of our energy landscape.<br/><br/>Since then, Matineh has been leading WattLearn's business and technology development, taking the company from an idea to its current state.</p>

WattLearn won first place at the TransTech Energy Business Development Competition at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, was invited to present at the Energy Storage Summit 2017 held by Green Tech Media, won the Peopleâ€™s Choice Award as the best energy startup at Plug & Play, and was a finalist startup presenter at the VERGE 18 conference, just to name a few accolades.<br/><br/>In November 2018, WattLearn was acquired by one of the countryâ€™s leading energy investment companies. This partnership has offered WattLearn the unique opportunity to implement its PLAAS solution on some of the countryâ€™s largest front of the meter battery projects.

We are looking for a driven and talented Senior Data Scientist to improve these algorithms as well as build new capabilities as we expand into new markets and value streams. As a key member of a small but experienced team, you will play an integral role in shaping the future of both the data science team and the company itself while also contributing to a more sustainable energy future. While your focus will be on Data Science, you will will have input into all parts of the product life cycle: research and ad hoc analyses, data processing and engineering, model development, testing and quality assurance, and even operations. Your work will be highly visible throughout the company and will contribute to the foundation for our go-to-market product. As one of the core members of the team, you will have direct input in building a roadmap to meet company milestones. The person who fills this role will report directly to the CEO.</p>
